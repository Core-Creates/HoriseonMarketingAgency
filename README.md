# README for Mock Horiseon Marketing Company (Homework 1)

## Description

Mock website for Horiseon Marketing Company. I refactored the code to make it accessable for users with screen readers.
I did this by replacing div tags with semantic tags without changin the websites layout or look. I also fixed a button 
that wasn't linking correctly. Lastly I condensed the code.
